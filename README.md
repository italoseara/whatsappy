## Project Update: Temporary Inactivity

Unfortunately, this repository is currently non-functional. I plan to allocate time in the future to revitalize it and ensure its usability. In the meantime, I hope this proves helpful to those embarking on their own adaptations. Thank you for your understanding.

## Overview

Whatsappy is a Python library for interacting with WhatsApp Web using Selenium. With this library, you can automate WhatsApp tasks such as sending messages, creating groups, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Chrome 94+
- WhatsApp Web in English

## Installation

You can install Whatsappy using pip:

```bash
pip install whatsappy-py
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how you can use Whatsappy to send a message:

```python
from whatsappy import Whatsapp

# Create a new instance of Whatsapp
whatsapp = Whatsapp()

# Create event handlers
@whatsapp.event
def on_ready():
    print("WhatsApp Web is ready!")

@whatsapp.event
def on_message(chat):
    print(f"New message from {chat.name}: {chat.message}")

# Open WhatsApp Web in Chrome
whatsapp.run()

# Select the chat you want to send a message to
chat = whatsapp.open("John Smith")

# Send a message
chat.send("Hello, John!")

# Close WhatsApp Web
whatsapp.close()
